# quantum-circuit-simulator
Using Python i managed to simulate the quantum circit and perform perform multi-shot measurement of all qubits using weighted random technique


#how to run the programme
  1.select the desired  gate index on line 7.and and its desired target qbits
  2.put that index on line 100 in the run the programe function
  3.The desired output will be printed  in the terminal
